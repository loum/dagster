# Overview

Dagster Apache Airflow has been architected as a cloud native service that leverages resources,
tooling and automation techniques (think DevOps) that promote rapid development cycles that are
platform independent (think hybrid cloud services). The goal here is to empower developers to
build capability in a locally managed context that should be immediately transferable to a
production-ised environment (think CI/CD) with minimal modifications.
